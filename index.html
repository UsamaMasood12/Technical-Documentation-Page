            Fruits are a rich source of vitamins, minerals, fibres and proteins.
            We should eat fresh fruits to keep ourselves healthy. But we should
            not eat cut fruits at the market as they are very unhygienic and can
            make us ill.
          </p>

          <p>
            We should wash fruits thoroughly before eating them. While some
            fruits are seasonal, others are available throughout the year. Some
            are very expensive while the others are reasonable.
          </p>

              Mangoes and cherries are my favourite fruits. I relish them the
              most. I like mangoes in all forms—juice, jam and pickle. Alphonso,
              Dussheri, Langda and Safeda are only some of the dozens of
              varieties of mangoes found in India.
            </li>
